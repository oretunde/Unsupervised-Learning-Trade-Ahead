## My Learning:
In this project, clustering techniques were applied to analyze stock market data, enabling better investment decision-making. Using financial indicators and stock prices from companies listed on the NYSE, the goal was to segment stocks into meaningful clusters based on shared characteristics.

The analysis involved two clustering methods: K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering (HC). For K-Means, the optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow method and silhouette scores. For Hierarchical Clustering, various distance metrics, including Euclidean and Manhattan, were tested alongside different linkage methods such as single, complete, average, and Wardâ€™s linkage. The cophenetic correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the clustering structures and identify the most effective metric-linkage combination. Additionally, dendrograms were analyzed to interpret hierarchical relationships and determine the best distance metric and the optimal number of clusters for segmentation.

Insights from both clustering techniques were used to develop stock segment profiles, allowing for a deeper understanding of stock relationships and aiding investors in aligning their strategies with data-driven market trends.
